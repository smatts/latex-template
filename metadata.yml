description: >-
  These are the lecture notes of my lecture on optical spectroscopy. The lecture aims
  at students in the first year of the master's program, but should be accessible
  also to students in the last year of the bachelor's program. You need some quantum
  mechanics and an introduction to the physics of molecules.


  The idea of this lecture was to focus on experiments. Each chapter is build around
  an experiment and tries to explain everything that is needed to appreciate that
  experiment. As I am convinced that one only understands something if one really
  has worked with the concepts, each chapter has a task, which is in many cases to
  evaluate 'real' experimental data, or to simulate the experiment in a computer.
  The chapters are rather independent of each other, although the order has some sense.
  One thus can choose appealing chapters and skip others.
