\chapter{Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy}


\section{Tasks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find all possible Feynman diagrams for a 3-level V-system, by hand or using a computer. Group them by their phase-matching condition. Assume some parameters and plot 2D spectra. The elearning course has some useful Matlab routines.

\item Investigate the possibility of 2D spectroscopy to find coupling between systems with the example of a 'diamond' level system. A ground state $\ket{0}$ is connected to a top-most excited state $\ket{3}$ via two 'paths' passing state $\ket{1}$ or $\ket{2}$. The energetic position of state $\ket{3}$ is $E_3 = E_1 + E_2 + \delta$ ($E_0= 0$). Discuss why $\delta = 0$ corresponds to two uncoupled systems. Plot the rephased and non-rephased spectra and their sum for zero and non-zero values of $\delta$.


\end{itemize}

\section{Interaction Picture}

A more complete introduction into 2D-spectroscopy and double-sided Feynman Diagrams can be found in \cite{Hamm-dummies} which is a short version of \cite{HammZanni2011} which is a short version of \cite{Mukamel1995}.


In the Schrödinger picture, all the time-dependence sits in the wave function
\begin{eqnarray}
 \hat{H} & = & const. \\
 \frac{d}{dt} \ket{\psi(t)} &=& - \frac{i}{\hbar} \, \hat{H} \, \ket{\psi(t)} \\
 \braket{\hat{A}} &=& \braket{\psi(t) \, | \,\hat{A} \, |\, \psi(t) } 
\end{eqnarray}
The solution to the differential equation for $\ket{\psi(t)}$ is
\begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi(t)} =  \exp \left(- \frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H} \, t \right) \,\ket{\psi(0)} 
\end{equation}


In the Heisenberg picture, all the time-dependence sits in the operator
\begin{eqnarray}
 \ket{\psi_H} &=& const. \\
 \frac{d}{dt} \hat{A}_H(t) &=& - \frac{i}{\hbar} \, \left[ \hat{H} , \hat{A}_H(t) \right] \\
 \braket{\hat{A}_H} &=& \braket{\psi \, | \,\hat{A}_H (t) \, |\, \psi } 
\end{eqnarray}
The solution to the differential equation for  $\hat{A}_H(t)$ is
\begin{equation}
 \hat{A}_H(t) = \exp \left(+ \frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H} \, t \right) \, \hat{A}(0) \, \exp \left(- \frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H} \, t \right) \quad .
\end{equation}
At time $t=0$ both pictures come together,i.e., $\hat{A}_H(0) = \hat{A}$ and $\psi_H = \psi(0)$ and of course both pictures give the same result  for the expectation value  of an operator.

In  this chapter, we use the  interaction picture, which is in a sense half-way between Schrödinger and Heisenberg: We assume a small perturbation $\hat{H}'(t)$ addition to an unperturbed $\hat{H}_0$
\begin{equation}
 \hat{H}(t) = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}'(t) \label{eq:2d_hamilton_perturbation}
\end{equation}
The effect of  $\hat{H}_0$ is to modify the operators, while $\hat{H}'(t)$ modifies the wave functions
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{d}{dt} \ket{\psi(t)} &=& - \frac{i}{\hbar} \, \hat{H}' \, \ket{\psi(t)}  \label{eq:2d_schroedinger_interaction}\\
 \frac{d}{dt} \hat{A}(t) &=& - \frac{i}{\hbar} \, \left[ \hat{H}_0 , \hat{A}(t) \right] \\
 \braket{\hat{A}} &=& \braket{\psi(t) \, | \,\hat{A} (t) \, |\, \psi(t) } 
\end{eqnarray}


In the interaction picture, we now can integrate up  the Schrödinger equation \ref{eq:2d_schroedinger_interaction} and transform  back into the Schrödinger picture. To keep things simple, I only show the results when transformed back. Intermediate steps are given in \cite{Hamm-dummies}.


We assume  that the system experiences a perturbation by the operator $\hat{H}'$ at time $\tau$, but evolves unperturbed in the remaining parts of the time interval from $t_0$ to $t$. We made the approximation that only one interaction takes place in that interval, which is only the first element of a power series. With that we get
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi(t)}  
  \approx  \ket{\psi(t_0)} - \frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{t_0}^t d \tau \,  U_0( t , \tau) \,\hat{H}'(\tau) \,  U_0 (\tau , t_0) \, \ket{\psi(t_0)}  \label{eq:2d_time_evol}
\end{equation}
with the operator for free (= unperturbed) time evolution $U_0$ from time $t_1$ to $t_2$
\begin{equation}
 U_0(t_2, t_1) = \exp \left(- \frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H}_0 \, ( t_2- t_1) \right)
\end{equation}



We are especially interested in the time evolution of the density matrix according to the Liouville-von Neumann equation. Starting from $\tau = t_0$, we take more and more interactions into account. $\rho^{(n)}$ describes the change of the density matrix assuming $n$ interactions between $\tau = t_0$ and $\tau = t$
\begin{equation}
\rho(t) = \rho_0  + \sum_n  \rho^{(n)} (t)
\end{equation}
where $\rho_0$ is the equilibrium density matrix which does not evolve in time.
The term for $n=1$ reads, equivalent to eq.  \ref{eq:2d_time_evol}  above,
\begin{equation}
 \rho^{(1)} (t) = - \frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{t_0}^t \, d\tau \, U_0(t, t_0) \, \left[ \hat{H}'_I(\tau) \, , \, \rho_0 \right] \, U_0^\star (t, t_0)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{H}'_I(\tau) $ is the perturbation operator in the interaction picture
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}'_I(\tau) =  U_0^\star (\tau , t_0) \, \hat{H}'(\tau) \, U_0 (\tau , t_0) \,
\end{equation}
 Multiple interactions now lead to cascaded commutators, i.e.
\begin{equation}
 \rho^{(2)} (t) = \left(- \frac{i}{\hbar}\right)^2   \int_{t_0}^t \, d\tau_2   \int_{t_0}^{\tau_2} \, d\tau_1 \, U_0(t, t_0) \, \left[ \hat{H}'_I(\tau_2) \, , \, \left[ \hat{H}'_I(\tau_1) \, , \, \rho_0 \right] \right] \, U_0^\star (t, t_0)
\end{equation}

In spectroscopy, we are interested in a perturbation operator $\hat{H}'$ that contains an $\mu \cdot E$ term for the incoming, exciting field. We see that $\rho^{(n)}$ depends on $n$ optical fields, so that we identify  these processes with the $n$-th order nonlinear processes described by the nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(n)}$. This nonlinear susceptibility creates a nonlinear polarization $P^{(n)}$. In quantum mechanics, this is the expectation value of the dipole operator 
\begin{equation}
P^{(n)} (t) = \braket{ \mu \, \rho^{(n)}(t) }
\end{equation}
For third-order nonlinear effects, we thus get
\begin{equation}
 \left(- \frac{i}{\hbar}\right)^3   \iiint E(\tau_3) E(\tau_2) E(\tau_1)
 \braket{ \mu \, 
  \left[ \mu_3 , \, \left[ \mu_2 , \, \left[ \mu_1 , \, \rho_0 \, \right] \right]  \right] }
  \label{eq:2d-p3-commutator}
\end{equation}
The cascaded commutator expands to $2^3=8$ terms, where one half is the complex-conjugate of the other, effectively giving $4$ terms.

In the experiment, the electric fields for a third-order nonlinearity would be created by three different laser pulses. Generally, each  electric field $E(\tau_i)$ at time $\tau_i$ could be a superposition of the three pulses. We make the approximation, that the pulses do not overlap in time (time ordering). We also assume that the pulses are shorter  than the time scale of the system\footnote{and thus shorter than the delay between the pulses}, but much longer than the oscillation period of the light wave. Each electric field can thus be described by two terms of the form $\exp( \pm i (\omega t - k r) )$. In total, this makes $2^3=8$ terms for the field, multiplied by the 4 terms from the commutator gives 32 terms.
In the remaining, we try to keep track of all these terms.


\section{Double-Sided Feynman Diagrams}

\begin{marginfigure}
\inputtikz{\currfiledir feynman_example}
\caption{
Example of a Double-Sided Feynman Diagram.}
\label{fig:2d_example_feynman}
\end{marginfigure}

The idea is to describe the evolution of the density matrix when interacting with multiple optical fields.
Time runs from bottom to top. The two vertical lines represent the ket (left) and bra (right) part of the density matrix element. The quantum numbers are written between the lines and we start from the ground state $\ket{0}\, \bra{0}$. Diagonal arrows represent the light fields interacting with the system. Inwards pointing arrows increase the quantum number, outwards pointing fields are the complex-conjugate with negative frequency that decrease the quantum number. The last, top-most arrow is drawn with a dashed or wavy line and represents the dipole operator $\mu$ outside the commutator in eq. \ref{eq:2d-p3-commutator}. This is the radiating nonlinear polarization. By convention, it is on the left side and points to the top left. This convention fixes the mirror symmetry that all schemes would exist also in a complex-conjugate form. At the end, after the nonlinear polarization is emitted, all coherences have to have vanished and the system has to be in a population state, i.e., both quantum number have to be identical\sidenote{but not necessarily zero}.



We still have the choice of the sign in $E \propto \exp( \pm i (\omega t - k r) )$. We write this as  $\exp(- i (\omega t - k r) )$ and chose the sign of $\omega$ and $k$.
A positive sign is represented by an arrow pointing to the right, a negative sign pointing to the left. The positive frequency is thus absorption at the left vertical line, or emission at the right, and the vice versa. Phase matching, i.e, $\Delta k = 0$ and the rotating wave approximation come together here. The number of left and right going arrows have to agree when including the special radiation polarization arrow.

Each diagram has an overall sign, stemming from the minus sign in the commutators in eq. \ref{eq:2d-p3-commutator}. The sign is $(-1)^m$ where $m$ is the number of interactions on the right side of the diagram.

The diagram represents a path between elements of the density matrix. As we have seen in the chapter on Rabi Oscillations when introducing the density matrix, a light field causes as first step a non-zero value of the corresponding off-diagonal element. A field acting from the left generates $\ket{1} \bra{0}$, while a field acting from the right generates $\ket{0} \bra{1}$. Figure \ref{fig:2d_liouville_path} shows possible paths in Liouville space.

\begin{marginfigure}
\inputtikz{\currfiledir liouville_path}

\caption{

\label{fig:2d_liouville_path}
\end{marginfigure}

At the end, we are interested in $P^{(3)}(t)$ or $P^{(3)}(\omega)$. We can easily obtain it by multiplying the elements along the path. In time domain\footcite{Mukamel1995,HammZanni2011,Hamm-dummies}, each interaction with an optical field contributes
\begin{equation}
 - \frac{i}{\hbar} \, \mu_{ba} \, E_i(t)  \, e^{-i \omega_i \, t}
\end{equation}
where $a$ ($b$) is the quantum number before (after) the interaction. When the arrow points to the left, the field is taken complex-conjugate (and thus with negative frequency, see below). The time interval $t_i$ between two interactions contributes 
%
\begin{equation}
 e^{-i \, \omega_{ab} \, t_i - \Gamma_{ab} \, t_i}
\end{equation}
%
where we have assumed the state to be $\ket{a} \bra{b}$, and 
$\hbar \omega_{ab} = E_a - E_b$ so that $\omega_{ab}  = - \omega_{ba} $. The last outgoing arrow of the radiating polarization only contributes a dipole moment, as this is the dipole moment multiplied to the left of the cascaded commutators.

In frequency domain\footcite{Boyd2008,Shen2003}, we get for the interactions
\begin{equation}
 - \frac{i}{\hbar} \, \mu_{ba} \, E_i(\omega_i)  
\end{equation}
The phase evolution during the time interval $t_j$ needs a Fourier transform. 
The Fourier-conjugate variable\footcite{Tokmakoff09} to $t_j$  is $\Omega_j$, which is the sum of all laser frequencies up to interaction $j$, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
 \Omega_j = \sum_{k=1}^j \pm \omega_k
\end{equation}
The sign is again taken from the direction of the arrow (positive to the right). We thus get
 by a Fourier transform\sidenote{Note that $P=0$ for $t_j < 0$}  along $t_j$ 
\begin{equation}
 e^{ (-i \omega_{ab} - \Gamma_{ab}) t_j }  \quad \rightarrow \quad
 \frac{i }{\Omega_j - \omega_{ab}  + i \Gamma_{ab} } 
\end{equation}




\section{Example: Pump-Probe Spectroscopy}

Let us discuss pump-probe spectroscopy as an example. As we have seen on the chapter in four-wave mixing, pump-probe spectroscopy is a third-order nonlinear optical process of the form
\begin{equation}
 P^{(3)} =  \chi^{(3)} E_\text{pump} \, E_\text{pump}^\star \, E_\text{probe}
\end{equation}
We assume for simplicity that the probe pulse comes after the pump pulse. The nonlinear emission has to be in the direction of the probe pulse so that it can serve as local oscillator. As the emitting arrow points to the left, the probe arrow has to point to the right. The sub-schemes A and B fulfil this requirement.


\begin{figure}
\inputtikz{\currfiledir feynman_pp_elements}

\caption{
Building blocks for the interaction of the probe pulse (panels A and B) and the pump-pulse (panels 1 to 4) in a pump-probe experiment.}
\label{fig:2d_feynman_pp_elements}
\end{figure}

The direction of the pump beam has to cancel out, $E_\text{pump} $ enters only as absolute-squared. This means that the two pump arrows have to point in different directions. The sub-schemes 1 to 4 fulfill this requirement.

\begin{figure}
\inputtikz{\currfiledir feynman_pump_probe}
\caption{
Six double-sided Feynman diagrams describe pump-probe spectroscopy.}
\label{fig:2d_feynman_pump_probe}
\end{figure}

Of the eight combinations two are not allowed. The variants A3 and A4 would describe  emission from ground state  $\ket{0} \bra{0}$ which is of course forbidden. Variants A2 and A2 describe stimulated emission, B1 and B2 excited state absorption and B3 and B4 ground state bleaching.

From the diagrams we can now read the nonlinear polarization, multiplying together the contribution of each interaction and the times $t_i$ between them.
For the diagram A1 and A2 we get
\begin{eqnarray}
P^{(3)}_{A1} & =& \frac{i}{\hbar^3} \,  E_1 E_2^\star E_3 \, \mu_{10}^4 \,
e^{ (-i \omega_{10} - \Gamma_{10}) t_1 } \,
e^{  - \Gamma_{11} t_2 } \,
e^{ (-i \omega_{10} - \Gamma_{10}) t_3 }  \\
P^{(3)}_{A2} & =& \frac{i}{\hbar^3} \,  E_1^\star E_2 E_3 \, \mu_{10}^4 \,
e^{ (+i \omega_{10} - \Gamma_{10}) t_1 } \,
e^{  - \Gamma_{11} t_2 } \,
e^{ (-i \omega_{10} - \Gamma_{10}) t_3 }  
\end{eqnarray}
where only the direction of the phase rotation during time interval $t_1$ between the first and second interaction changes (and the field that enters stared). In pump-probe spectroscopy we assume that both $E_1$ and $E_2$ stem from the same laser pulse, the pump pulse, and that we can neglect $t_1$ as the pulse is short. We thus get for stimulated emission (SE)
\begin{eqnarray}
P^{(3)}_{SE} & =& 2 \frac{i}{\hbar^3} \,  | E_\text{pump}|^2 E_\text{probe} \, \mu_{10}^4 \,
e^{  - \Gamma_{11} t_2 } \,
e^{ (-i \omega_{10} - \Gamma_{10}) t_3 } 
\end{eqnarray}
In a similar way we get for excited state absorption (ESA) and ground state bleaching (GSB)
\begin{eqnarray}
P^{(3)}_{ESA} & =& -2 \frac{i}{\hbar^3} \,  | E_\text{pump}|^2 E_\text{probe} \, \mu_{10}^2 \mu_{21}^2 \,
e^{  - \Gamma_{11} t_2 } \,
e^{ (-i \omega_{21} - \Gamma_{21}) t_3 }  \\
P^{(3)}_{GSB}  & =& 2 \frac{i}{\hbar^3} \,  | E_\text{pump}|^2 E_\text{probe} \, \mu_{10}^4 \,
e^{ (-i \omega_{10} - \Gamma_{10}) t_3 } 
\end{eqnarray}
The minus sign in the ESA term stems from the global sign of the diagram, as the ESA diagrams have only one interaction from the right side. The GSB term does not contain a decay of the population during time interval $t_2$, as the ground state does not decay. When we neglect the decay of the population during $t_2$, the terms for GSB and SE are identical. The nonlinear polarization is the sum of these three terms.


As discussed in the chapter on the free induction decay, a polarization (or coherence) is source of a radiated field that interference with a local oscillator, if present. In pump-probe spectroscopy, the probe field acts as local oscillator. The pump-induced variation in the probe power is caused by the cross term of local oscillator and signal field
\begin{equation}
 \Delta P = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 \int_\text{pulse}  2 E_\text{probe} \; \Im (E_\text{signal} ) \, dt 
 = N L \frac{k}{2}  \int_\text{pulse}   E_\text{probe} \; \Im ( P^{(3)} ) \, dt
\end{equation}

For pump-probe spectroscopy we get for the differential spectrum, assuming a spectrally flat probe pulse with $\omega_3 = \omega_\text{probe}$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta P (\omega_3)} {P_\text{probe}(\omega_3)} 
\propto
%=  N L \frac{k}{2 \sqrt{2 \pi} \hbar^3}  | E_\text{pump}|^2  \left( 
- \frac{4 \, \mu_{10}^4 \, \Gamma_{10} } { (\omega_3 - \omega_{10})^2 + \Gamma_{10}^2} 
+ \frac{2 \, \mu_{10}^2  \, \mu_{21}^2 \, \Gamma_{21} } { (\omega_3 - \omega_{21})^2 + \Gamma_{21}^2} 
%\right)
\end{equation}


\section{Example: Two-Photon Absorption}

The formalism of double-sided Feynman diagrams allows us to obtain results from perturbation theory by just reading the diagram. For comparison, we turn back to the example of \cite{Winterhalder11}, discussed in the last chapter. We read the $\nu g $-coherence as
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\nu g}(t_1, t_2) = \frac{(-i)^2}{\hbar^2} \, \mu_{eg} \, \mu_{\nu e} \, E_1 \, E_2 \,
e^{-i \omega_{eg} t_1 - \Gamma_{eg} t_1} \, 
e^{-i \omega_{\nu g} t_2 - \Gamma_{\nu g} t_2} 
\end{equation}
Fourier transformation leads to
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_{\nu g}(\omega_1, \omega_2) &=& \frac{(-i)^2}{\hbar^2} \, \mu_{eg} \, \mu_{\nu e} \, E_1 \, E_2 \,
    \frac{i }{\Omega_1 - \omega_{eg}  + i \Gamma_{eg} } 
  \, \frac{i }{\Omega_2  -\omega_{\nu g}  + i \Gamma_{\nu g} } \\
  %
  &=& \frac{\mu_{eg} \, \mu_{\nu e} \, E_1 \, E_2 }{\hbar^2} \,
  \frac{1 }{\omega_1 - \omega_{eg}  + i \Gamma_{eg} } 
  \, \frac{1}{\omega_1 - \omega_2  -\omega_{\nu g}  + i \Gamma_{\nu g} } 
\end{eqnarray}
which is eq. 1b in \cite{Winterhalder11}.
 

\section{2D spectroscopy}


In contrast to pump-probe spectroscopy, we now assume that all three interactions happen at three different times so that we do not neglect any time interval $t_i$ anymore. However, all three pulses stem from the same laser, have the same spectrum, but individual propagation directions $k_i$. In 2D spectroscopy, in most cases one detects the generated nonlinear polarization by  interfering it with a fourth laser pulse acting as local oscillator\footcite{Ogilvie15,Scholes13}. In some variants, one uses the fourth pulse to generate a population that is then detected via electron or fluorescence emission. Also in some cases, not the propagation direction $k_i$ but an individual phase $\phi_i$ is used to distinguish the pulses. In the following discussion, we stick with the most common or 'traditional' approach.

\begin{marginfigure}
\inputtikz{\currfiledir fwm_phase_matching}

\caption{The phase-matching direction selects the observed process. Interference with a local oscillator (LO) after reflection at a beam splitter (BS) allows detection (det) of a complex-valued polarization.}
\label{fig:2d_setup_phasematch}
\end{marginfigure}


How can we do spectroscopy when all laser pulses have the same spectrum? The approach is the same as in Fourier transform (infrared) spectroscopy. Two laser pulses separated by a short time interval interfere with each other and lead to a sinusoidal modulation of the combined spectrum. Fourier transform from the delay time interval to frequency space then gives the frequency axis for spectroscopy. In 2D spectroscopy, we Fourier-transform along the first and third time interval. During these times, the system is in a coherent superposition between two states, described by the density matrix element $\ket{a}\bra{b}$ with $a \neq b$. The second, not Fourier-transformed time interval is called population time, as here the system is (typically) in a population state $\ket{a}\bra{a}$. Note that the third time interval needs an end. It ends via the radiation of the nonlinear polarization. This is not controlled by a laser pulse on the system. However, when we use the fourth laser pulse as local oscillator, we can decide at which  time we want to amplify and then detected the emitting polarization. Or we let physics do the Fourier transform and detected the emitted radiation without further interference by a spectrometer, which does not need time resolution.\sidenote{We detect $|P|^2$ in this way, not the complex valued $P$.}

We obtain 2D spectra, along an excitation and a detection frequency, for a fixed population time interval $t_2$. One can imagine getting similar spectra by scanning both pump and probe wavelength in a pump-probe experiment. One big difference is that the pulses in such a pump-probe experiment would need to be rather long, as they need to be spectrally rather narrow. This limits the time resolution in $t_2$. With the four-pulse experiment, we get both high time resolution and spectral information.

Which features do we find in a 2D spectrum? Along the diagonal, it contains the linear absorption spectrum. We pump and probe the same molecules. If our ensemble of molecules is inhomogeneously broadened, i.e., the molecules differ in absorption wavelength much more than the width of their individual absorption spectrum, then the peak in the 2D spectrum will be elongated along the diagonal and narrow along the anti-diagonal. We pump one sub-ensemble of molecules, and only these will not be able to absorb the probe pulse. 2D spectroscopy thus can distinguish between homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening, similar to spectral hole burning.


\begin{marginfigure}
\inputtikz{\currfiledir inhom_broadening}

\caption{An inhomogeneous ensemble of molecules leads to a elongated peak in the 2D spectrum. Along the anti-diagonal direction it has the \emph{homogeneous} linewidth.}
\label{fig:2d_inhom_broadening}
\end{marginfigure}



2D spectroscopy can also find coupled (or interacting) systems. With linear spectroscopy, we only find the energy difference between initial and final state. When we have two peaks in an absorption spectrum, we cannot say if there are three or four states involved. We could have two  different molecules (4 states) or a V level system in one molecule (3 states). 2D spectroscopy can decide this question: In the coupled case, we find cross-peaks at the  other two corners  of the square which is formed by the two transition frequencies. At these points, we pump one transition and find an influence on the other transition. This is only possible if these transitions are somehow coupled. Molecule A would not care if molecule B would be excited.

\begin{figure}
\inputtikz{\currfiledir sketch_cross_peaks}

\caption{Cross-peaks outside the diagonal (blue circles) signal coupling between systems. This information is not present in the linear absorption spectrum.}
\label{fig_2d_crosspeak}
\end{figure}


\section{Rephasing}

The set of all allowed double-sided Feynman diagrams for a given quantum-mechanical system can be grouped by their phase-matching condition, i.e., the signs on front of the $\pm k_i$. An important property of these groups of diagrams is whether rephasing occurs or not. The question is how the coherences during interval one and three are related. When the system is during interval one in state $\ket{a}\bra{b}$  and then during interval three in state $\ket{b}\bra{a}$, this is called rephasing. Both intervals cancel their phase contribution to $P^{(3)}$, as
\begin{equation}
  e^{- i \omega_{ba} \, t_1} \,   e^{- i \omega_{ab} \, t_3} =   e^{- i  \omega_{ba} \, ( t_1 - t_3)}
\end{equation}
This is important as the transition energy $\hbar \omega_{ba}$ varies between different molecules in an ensemble and fluctuates for a single molecule during time. In rephasing diagrams the influence of this inhomogeneity is canceled out. This is very similar to the echo formation in pulsed NMR, as the sign of the phase factor represents the rotation direction. Rephasing diagrams let the phase rotate first in one direction, then in the opposite direction, so that all 'runners' arrive together again.\footnote{See the 'runner' example for NMR echos is this sounds strange to you.} When adding rephasing and non-rephasing 2D spectra, one obtains a purely absorptive spectrum which has narrow peaks and no side-effects from Fourier transform.
